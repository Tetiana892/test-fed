# Test Task

## Overview
This project is a simple web application for interacting with text. It provides the following features:

1. Enter a string in a text field.
2. Display the string as individual characters that can be selected and manipulated.
3. Select individual characters or groups of characters using **Ctrl + Click** or a **selection rectangle**.
4. Highlight selected characters by changing their color.
5. Drag and drop characters or groups of characters to reorder them, with proper swapping between letters and no overlapping.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file directly in your browser (no server required).
3. Enter text in the input field and interact with the displayed characters to test the functionality.

## Key Features
- **Character Highlighting**: Use **Ctrl + Click** or a **selection rectangle** to select and highlight individual characters or groups of characters.
- **Drag and Drop**: Reorder characters or groups using drag-and-drop.
